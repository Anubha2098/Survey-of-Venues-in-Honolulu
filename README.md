# Survey-of-Venues-in-Honolulu
The objective of this Capstone Project done as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification is finding the most suitable place to eat when one visits Honolulu, USA. There are many venues (including restaurants, cafes) that can be explored. It helps us to find the best place to eat based on average price and user ratings. Using methods learnt over the course of this specialization such as clustering, this project aims to find the solution to the problem: Where to eat when I visit Honolulu.
